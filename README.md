# Unity Platformer

This is a small Unity Demo platformer I made to help with learning unity and showcase my knowledge in the engine.

The Game is a basic platformer that uses A/D or the arrow keys, as well as the space bar, for movement, but also includes controller support for the game.

A wall slide and wall jump feature has been implemented as well as a functioning main menu and pause menu.

Showcase photos and videos can be found in the Demo folder in the root of the project.
